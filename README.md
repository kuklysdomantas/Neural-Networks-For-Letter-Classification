# Neural Networks For Letter Classification

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the basic application of neural networks in image classification, specifically aimed at recognizing letters from a dataset. The project utilizes deep learning techniques and image augmentation to enhance the robustness of the model. The primary goal is to build a neural network model that classifies images of letters and predicts certain binary attributes from the image data.

This neural network project focuses on classifying images of letters using deep learning techniques. The project is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras and works with a dataset of images that are preprocessed by resizing them to 32x32 pixels and normalizing their pixel values. The neural network used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is ideal for image processing tasks.

The network's architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max pooling layers. These layers extract features from the images, which are then passed through dense layers. The model outputs two different predictions: one for binary classification (whether the image is rotated) and another for multi-class classification (predicting the letter represented by the image). The final layer for binary classification uses a sigmoid activation function, while the multi-class classification layer uses a softmax activation function to predict one of 25 possible letter classes.

During the training process, the model's accuracy is evaluated for both the binary and classification outputs. The model is trained on 70% of the data and tested on the remaining 30% using a batch size of 16 and running for 60 epochs. After training, the accuracy of the model is assessed for both training and test datasets.

The accuracy of the neural network in this project may be influenced by the relatively limited number of images in the dataset. Neural networks, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for image classification, typically perform better when trained on larger datasets. A larger quantity of training images allows the model to learn a more diverse set of features, improving its generalization to unseen data.
